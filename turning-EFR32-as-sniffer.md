# EFR32 Sniffer Tool – Configuration Guide

## Overview

The **EFR32 Sniffer Tool** is designed to help developers and engineers monitor and analyze wireless communication traffic using EFR32-based boards. It transforms your development board into a sniffer device, allowing for real-time traffic inspection across supported wireless protocols such as **IEEE 802.15.4**, **Bluetooth Low Energy**, and **IEEE 802.15.4 Sub-GHz**.

This tool is particularly useful in:

- **Debugging communication issues** within wireless applications.
- **Validating packet structures** and protocol compliance.
- **Monitoring wireless environments** during development and testing phases.
- **Gaining visibility into over-the-air data**, which is essential for troubleshooting and optimization.

> ℹ️ This guide focuses on configuring the sniffer using the **Sniffer Configurator Tool**, which is the recommended and user-friendly method supported by the Simplicity Studio environment.
